        <!--Geert's Venn diagram-->
        <para>Bitching about our projects, we came to realize that all projects seem to follow a
            similar pattern. Higly simplified, this pattern can be explained through the below
            diagram.</para>
        <para>If we reduce the number of stakeholders in a project to three only, one can state that
            there is always someone (or a team) in power, a team doing the technical work and
            consultant either providing advice or helping development.</para>
        <para>All these stakeholders have a certain view on the project: where the resource should
            go, what technology or approach should be used and what the best route to success would
            be. Obviously the project's succes would depend on the large space where views
            meet.</para>
        <para>However we came to the conclusion that this zone of succes, for various undefined
            reasons, often is a "hidden zone" or even a "forbidden zone".</para>

                <para>No harm in being a grumpy old woman here.</para>
            </footnote>, with some years of angled brackets under your belt - you will recognise
            this diagram, nodding and bitterly thinking back in time. You will have had many
            experiences relating directly to this simple diagram. Memories.</para>
        <para>This is a paper about those memories. We'll go through some of
                <emphasis>our</emphasis> memories, reliving the key points, bitching about what we
            went through while thinking - hoping, even - that you'll be nodding right along with
            us.</para>

        <title>We Label Ourselves as the <quote>Grumpy Old Men</quote></title>
        <para>Let us introduce ourselves. We're a pair of somewhat aged markup geeks, having worked
            in the field for some 50 years combined, a lot of which was spent bitching about what
            had already been. This is not the paper that will reveal all. However, it is the paper
            that will discuss some of the implications of those 50 years.</para>
        <para>Or at least have a few laughs while reminiscing.</para>
        <para>Consider this Venn diagram.</para>

                <para>No harm in being a grumpy old woman here.</para>
            </footnote>, with some years of angled brackets under your belt - you will recognise
            this diagram, nodding and bitterly thinking back in time. You will have had many
            experiences relating directly to this simple diagram. Memories.</para>
        <para>This is a paper about those memories. We'll go through some of
                <emphasis>our</emphasis> memories, reliving the key points, bitching about what we
            went through while thinking - hoping, even - that you'll be nodding right along
            us.</para>
